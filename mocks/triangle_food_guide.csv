Atlantic Garden Bar,Drinks,$10-$15,4.5/5,Raleigh,"Limited draft menu, and plants were kind of expensive. However, I did enjoy the vibes! I had a great time, but not tons of room for sitting. Sip and walk :) "

City Market Sushi,Sushi,$30-$50,4.7/5,Raleigh,
Compass Rose Brewery,Drinks,$10-$20,4.4/5,Raleigh,"I put this place on my list thinking it was just a brewery. HOWEVER, they have a random assortment of food they make as well. To be quite honest, their gyro is probably one of my favorites that I've tried in Raleigh."

Dos Taquitos,Mexican,$20-$30,4.5/5,Raleigh,"They have a limited menu if you're not a fan of trying new things. They do their own take on ""traditional"" dishes, but I really enjoyed it! The experience of the queso/guac train was really fun lol. It was good, but it was really overhyped for me. It was *good*, just not my favorite! I still would go again though."

House of Hops,Drinks,$10-$20,4.8/5,Raleigh,One of my favorite places to hang out and drink with friends. The staff is super friendly as well! Great selection of beers and ciders for a decent price.
Hummingbird,New American,$20-$30,4.5/5,Raleigh,
Jose and Sons,Mexican,$20-$30,4.3/5,Raleigh,This is my go-to Mexican restaurant in Raleigh. You honestly can't go wrong here.

Layered Croissanterie,Bakery,$10-$20,4.7/5,Raleigh,
Lime and Lemon,Indian,$20-$30,4.8/5,Raleigh/Durham,"I loved the food here! I appreciate the varying spice levels. I tried ""medium"" heat the first time because I didn't want to go overboard, and it was pretty average spice level. Next time I got ""hot"" and it was perfect! The waiter was really nice and gave us suggestions on what to try."

Perry's Steakhouse,Steakhouse,$100+,4.1/5,Raleigh,
Pineapple Sol,Brunch,$10-$20,4.1/5,Cary,"To be quite honest, it's mid at best. I went the first time, and I probably would've given it 4 stars. The second time I went, the food was extremely mediocre for the price. My husband and I spent almost $50 between the two of us, and we only got a meal each and he got coffee. My food was mostly flavorless, and my husband had to add a ton of salt and hot sauce to make his meal good. Not worth the price at all. "
Q Noodles,Asian,$10-$20,4.6/5,Cary,"I would give this place a million stars if I could. They have a $4 dim sum lunch menu, which was amazing. Everything I tried there was awesome and super flavorful. They accidentally brought us the wrong item, and they let us keep it while they brought us the correct item, and they took off the item they got incorrect."
Raleigh Cheesy,Charcuterie,$25-$100,4.9/5,Raleigh,
Red Crab Seafood,Seafood,$30-$50,4.4/5,Raleigh,
Royal India,Indian,$20-$30,4.8/5,Raleigh,

Seoul Garden,Asian,$10-$20,4.4/5,Raleigh/Cary,
So Hot,Hot Pot,$30-$50,4.8/5,Cary,"The first Hot Pot place I've been to, and it was really enjoyable! No notes, I thought every aspect was delightful and the food was great."
STIR,Brunch and Seafood,$20-$30,4.2/5,Raleigh,"I haven't been here for brunch, but I went for dinner and it was pretty good! Their charcuterie board was probably my favorite part. I've heard their brunch is fantastic though, so I'll definitely be going back."
Sushi Mon,Sushi,$15-$30,4.7/5,Raleigh,
Sushi Nine,Sushi,$10-$20,4.3/5,Raleigh,"My favorite go-to casual sushi place! A lot of people are scared to go there after the norovirus outbreak a while back, but I promise it's worth it! It really is a clean place, don't let something that wasn't their fault impact your views of this place! They also have a 50% off bottle of wine special on Wednesdays. It's a great date night."
The Capital Grille,Steakhouse,$100+,4.6/5,Raleigh,"I felt very fancy coming here, and the food was stellar! The service was top-notch. We were brought a dish that the chef was ""testing out"" (I'm sure they give that to everyone), but I was actually allergic so the waiter brought me a dessert instead."
The Mill,New American,$20-$30,4.3/5,Raleigh,"It was good, I wouldn't say it was *great* for the price. I had a fun time, but I was really disappointed by the meat and cheese board they had. It was $25 for 3 hard cheeses and 3 meats. They forgot the bread to go with it at first, but when they brought it out it was about 5 tiny slices. Not worth it to me, but I would go back with other people!"
The Oak Kitchen and Bourbon Bar,New American,$20-$40,4.6/5,Raleigh,"The drink selection here is really nice. To be honest, I preferred their ""bar bites"" over main dishes. My go-to is to get 2-3 bar bites with my partner, and some drinks. The brussel sprouts are something I still dream about."
Trophy Brewing,Drinks,$10-$20,4.6/5,Raleigh,"Can't go wrong if you like beer! One of their locations has pizza, which is pretty good."

Urban Turban,Indian,$20-$30,4.8/5,Durham,
V Pizza,Pizza and Wings,$10-$20,4.4/5,Cary,"This place has probably some of the best wings I've ever eaten. Only problem is they get cold pretty quickly, so either eat there or heat it up once you get home. No complaints about the pizza either, I thought it was delicious!"
Vidrio,Mediterranean,$50-$100,4.5/5,Raleigh,
Vic's Italian Resturant and Pizzeria,Italian/Pizza,$20-$30,4.4/5,Raleigh,"Their meat lovers pizza is genuinely the best I've ever had. All the meats were quality meats, and relatively not greasy. Very good meat to cheese ratio and toppings to sauce and crust ratio. Desserts are frozen, which isn't a deal breaker for me, except my tiramusu was frozen being served. "
